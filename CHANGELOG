    * RELEASE: python-qualysconnect-0.0.8

    * (Author: Parag Baxi - ghee22) Fixed logging bug.  Library
      had initially used the global 'root' logger to handle log
      messages.  A module level handler has been added and logging
      shifted to it.

    * RELEASE: python-qualysconnect-0.0.6
    
    * Making 'ipaddr' an 'install_requires' entry in setup.py
      to auto install.  The old code is there and will still
      work if ipaddr isn't there, but I will be removing it
      in the next release.
      
    * Moved GETREQ data to DEBUG logging level. At INFO
      level logging could emit passwords.

    * Fixed over zealous permissions check on ~/.qcrc -- warn
      and do not impose.  Users must know clear text passwords
      are on disk.  Do what you must to protect them.
      
    * Miscellaneous bug fixes.


2012-05-10 Colin Bell <colin.bell@uwaterloo.ca>
    
    * RELEASE: python-qualysconnect-0.0.5

    * Making 'lxml' an 'install_requires' entry in setup.py
      so it should automatically install now.

    * Included community 'ipaddr' code to util.py. At
      this point I think the rudimentary IP utilities will
      eventually be removed and ipaddr-py will become a
      hard dependency. Either way though, new requirements
      are not to be taken lightly so both old and new ways
      should work. 

    * Cleaned up some duplicated code in
      qualysconnect/connect.py and split 'request' into
      'build_request' and 'request'. The request returns
      .read() on the HTTP opener.  build_request returns
      the prepped HTTP opener for people manipulating large
      datasets.  Eventually, throttling + continuation will
      need to be implemented to make this really powerful.


2012-03-06 Colin Bell <colin.bell@uwaterloo.ca>

    * RELEASE: python-qualysconnect-0.0.4

    * Added ability to build reports for specific
      IPs and/or IP ranges. (-i option)

    * Learned a hard lesson about Mecurial merging
      mistakes.  :-S  Abandoning 'development' branch
      for the time being for local clones. Will look
      to use cleaner formal versioned development
      trees.


2012-01-25 Colin Bell <colin.bell@uwaterloo.ca>

    * RELEASE: python-qualysconnect-0.0.3

    * Addition of a qreports.py tool for accessing
      Qualys reports.  I use this for building simple
      shell scripts/cron jobs to launch and download
      reports.

    * Addition of AUTHORS file to include other contributors. 


2011-08-04 Colin Bell <colin.bell@uwaterloo.ca>

    * RELEASE: python-qualysconnect-0.0.2

    * Creation of CHANGELOG file

    * Addition of qscanhist.py script.  A stub to start
      trying to make a tool to query 

    * In qualysconnect/qg/xmlproc.py changed name
      QGXP_process_host_list -> QGXP_hostlist_to_list

    * Miscellaneous cleanup.
